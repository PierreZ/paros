# TLA+ specs

Small TLA+ models of one protocol rule. A model is checked with TLC before the rule is written
in `paros-core`. A model does not replace the simulation: it searches a small abstract protocol
completely, and the simulation tests the code that ships.

## How to run

    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh          # the checks that CI runs
    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh --all    # the long checks too

`tlc` is also in the default dev shell. CI runs the first command in the `TLA` workflow, only
when a spec, the script or the flake changes.

## Layout

Each folder is one model:

- `<Name>.tla`: the spec.
- `MC.tla`: the constants that a TLC configuration file cannot write (tuples, sets of sets).
- `<check>.cfg`: one TLC configuration.
- `checks.txt`: one line for each configuration, with the result that it must give (`pass` or
  `violation`) and where it runs (`ci` or `long`).

A check that must give `violation` is a control. It shows that the model can find the bug that
the rule prevents. A model with no control proves little.

## Models

### `zero-stall/`: Phase-1 bypassing for #579 (zero-stall reconfiguration)

The model is Matchmaker MultiPaxos (Whittaker et al., §3 and §4) with matchmakers, one
configuration for each ballot, Phase 1 over every prior configuration, and a leader that moves
from its ballot `b` to its next ballot `b2` with no Phase 1 for the free slots.

Constants select the variant:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Owner` | `OwnerPaper3`: the paper's rounds `(r, id, s)`, a proposer owns two consecutive ballots. `OwnerParos3`: paros's `(round, node)`, a ballot of another proposer is between. |
| `Check` | `TRUE`: bypass only if the matchmaker answers show no registration between `b` and `b2`. |
| `Mode` | `carry`: the leader proposes its own values again at `b2`, with no Phase 1. `p212`: frankenpaxos `Phase212`, the slots below the frontier get a Phase 1 at `b2`. `none`: no bypass. |

The invariant is `Agreement`: one value is chosen for each slot.

The model has three ballots, three matchmakers, two values, one or two slots and two
configurations of two acceptors.

Not in the model: GC watermarks, matchmaker generations, leaderless reads (the decision hold),
lost durable state and the cooperative handoff.

Results are in `zero-stall/checks.txt` and in the design document of #579 (zero-stall
reconfiguration).

### `retire-fence/`: when a removed node may shut down, for #1002 (retire fence gaps)

The model is the control side of Matchmaker Paxos: campaigns that register a belief,
reconfigurations, the GC watermark of each matchmaker, and the retirement of a node. It has no
values and no votes. It answers one question: after a node retires, does each later campaign
still get a Phase-1 quorum of each configuration that the matchmakers give it?

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Fence` | `none`: the fence `last_member_ballot` moves only when the node hears a configuration that names it. `volatile`: a campaign also raises the fence of the node that registers, and a restart loses it (#893 (retire fence)). `durable`: the fence survives a restart. |
| `Ask` | `none`: the node retires on the five conditions of `may_retire`. `quorum`: it first asks a matchmaker quorum, and a matchmaker says yes if it holds no registration above the watermark that names the node. `quorumTomb`: the same, and a matchmaker that said yes refuses each later registration that names the node. `allTomb`: as `quorumTomb`, but every matchmaker must say yes. `quorumPrune`: as `quorumTomb`, and a candidate drops a registration from its answers when a matchmaker quorum in those answers recorded, below that registration, the retirement of a node that it names. |
| `OperatorRule` | `TRUE`: the operator retires no node that a reconfiguration above the watermark names, and names no retired node in a reconfiguration. |
| `Phase1All` | `TRUE`: a Phase-1 quorum is every member (`q1 = n`). `FALSE`: a majority. |

The invariants are `Electable` (each matchmaker quorum gives only configurations that still have
a Phase-1 quorum) and `SomeElectable` (at least one matchmaker quorum does).

The model has three nodes, a shrink from three members to two with `q1 = n`, three matchmakers,
two ballots and one restart.

Results (`retire-fence/checks.txt`):

| Rule | `Electable` | `SomeElectable` |
|---|---|---|
| No fence, the #893 fence, a durable fence | violation | |
| Durable fence and a quorum ask (the plan of #1002 on 2026-11-11) | violation | violation |
| Durable fence, a quorum ask, and the matchmakers refuse later registrations | violation | pass |
| Durable fence, every matchmaker answers and refuses later registrations | pass | |

The quorum rule with pruning (`quorumPrune`, added on 2026-11-12 to answer "what if a matchmaker is
not accessible?"):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `PruneSafe`: a candidate drops only a registration whose campaign never completed its matchmaking phase | pass |
| `ElectableAll`: with an answer of every matchmaker, no campaign is stranded | pass |
| `ElectableOneDown`: the same with one matchmaker down | violation |

So the two rules that are safe differ in what waits for a matchmaker that is down. With
`allTomb`, a retirement waits. With `quorumPrune`, an election can wait: a candidate needs the
answers of the matchmakers that recorded the retirement, and one of them can be the one that is
down. An election is on the availability path and a retirement is not, thus `allTomb` is the
rule to ship. In the `quorumPrune` checks, a campaign in the model does not win by pruning: the
invariants judge what a candidate would get in each state.

The quorum ask fails because a registration can arrive after the answer. A slow campaign of a
member that still believes the old configuration registers it at a matchmaker after that
matchmaker said yes. The last row also passes with `OperatorRule = FALSE`: the matchmakers then
check the operator's half of the retirement contract.

Not in the model: values and votes, the promises of the acceptors, matchmaker generations, the
pages of an answer and lost matchmaker state.

### `handover-gc/`: the GC floor across a handover, for #1014 (model of the handover and the GC floor)

The model is one handover of a matchmaker set, from the set `M0` to the set `M1`, with the GC
floor and the registrations of each matchmaker. It has no values, no votes and no acceptors. It
answers two questions. When a leader reports a floor as effective, does a majority of each
generation in force hold that floor? When a matchmaking phase closed at a majority, does each
majority of the generation in force still give that registration, unless a floor passed it?

A matchmaker of `M0` freezes and reports its floor and its registrations (`Stopped`). The
successor state is the maximum floor of a majority of reports and the union of their
registrations (`close_stop`). A member of `M1` activates with that state.

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Collector` | `watermark`: the collector counts each ack whose watermark is at or above the floor, applied or refused (`Collector::fold_ack` today). `applied`: it counts only an ack that applied the request. |
| `PoolLag` | `TRUE`: the leader cannot learn the later set from a refusal, because a member of `M1` is not in its pool yet. The refusal goes to the collector. `FALSE`: the leader learns the later set and drops the ack. |
| `CloseFloor` | `max`: the successor floor is the maximum of the reports. `one`: it is the floor of one report. |
| `FrozenRegisters` | `TRUE`: a frozen matchmaker still registers a ballot. |

The invariants are `FloorCarried` (the first question) and `RegCarried` (the second).

The model has the sets `{X, Y, Z}` and `{Y, Z, W}` and two ballots.

Results (`handover-gc/checks.txt`):

| Rule | Invariant | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `watermark` collector, the leader cannot learn the later set | `FloorCarried` | violation |
| `watermark` collector, the leader learns the later set | `FloorCarried` | pass |
| `applied` collector, the leader cannot learn the later set | `FloorCarried` | pass |
| The successor floor is the floor of one report | `FloorCarried` | violation |
| A frozen matchmaker registers | `RegCarried` | violation |
| The rules of today | `RegCarried` | pass |

The first row is a floor that is effective at no majority. `X` applies the floor of ballot 1 at
generation 0. The handover closes on the reports of `Y` and `Z`, with the floor 0. Ballot 2
raises the floor of `Y` at generation 1. `Y` then refuses the request of ballot 1 for generation
0, and its refusal carries the watermark 2. The collector of ballot 1 counts `X` and `Y`: the
floor 1 is effective, but `Z` and `W` hold the floor 0. This is class 5 of item 4 of #903
(matchmaker safety and liveness).

Not in the model: the decree that chooses the successor, lost matchmaker state, the effective
configuration, the size of the successor set and more than one journal.

### `tenant-move/`: the move of a tenant between two cells, for #1015 (model of the tenant move with abort)

The model is the control plane of a move: the directory, the registry record of the tenant in
each cell, the desk of each coordinator term with its fold of the tenant control journal, and
the claim on that journal. A journal is the cell that holds its configuration in force and the
cells whose machines stopped it. The Paxos layer is not in the model. The steps are those of the
safety review of 2026-11-11 (#1000 (tenant move safety review)).

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `DeskRule` | `cached`: the desk of a term claims and reads the tenant control journal one time, and an arrival uses that fold (#1004 (returned tenant's journals not moved)). `fresh`: each arrival claims and reads again. |
| `Pause`, `ReconfFence` | `Pause = TRUE`: a coordinator step reads its registry and sends its `Reconfigure` later (finding F4 of the review). `ReconfFence = TRUE`: a `Reconfigure` towards a cell is refused when the registry of that cell does not show the tenant as hosted. |
| `Abort` | `none`: no abort (`main`). `direct`: the operator clears the move in the directory, and a cell that the directory does not name leaves the tenant. `acked`: the operator marks the move as aborting, the target gives each journal back and records the abort, and the operator clears the move only on that record. A target that settled first wins, and the operator finishes the move. |
| `AdoptFence` | `TRUE`: the registry refuses an `AdoptTenant` for a move at or below the last move that it adopted or aborted. |

The invariants are `NoLostJournal` (no live journal is stopped on the machines of the cell that
holds its configuration, I2 of the review), `SettleComplete` (a settled target holds each live
journal), `NoStray` (with no open move, the cell of the directory holds each live journal) and
`NotStuck` (an arrival waits for no journal that is not live).

The model has two cells, two journals, and two to four moves.

Results (`tenant-move/checks.txt`):

| Rule | Result |
|---|---|
| `cached` desk: the trace of #1004, 17 steps | violation of `NoLostJournal` |
| `cached` desk: the arrival waits for a deleted journal | violation of `NotStuck` |
| A paused `Reconfigure` with no fence (F4), 12 steps | violation of `NoStray` |
| `fresh` desk and the `Reconfigure` fence | pass, each invariant |
| `direct` abort | violation of `NoLostJournal` |
| `acked` abort with no fence on `AdoptTenant` | violation of `NoStray` |
| `acked` abort with the fence | pass, each invariant |

The `acked` abort is a design proposal for #232 (multiple cells), not a recorded decision. The
last step where an abort can win is `SettleTenant`: the two writes go to the registry of the
target, thus the registry orders them.

Not in the model: the Paxos layer, the matchmaker set, `MovePeers` and the cell fence, the
removal of a tenant, two operators (finding F6), a stale read of the directory by a source
coordinator, footprints, and liveness (TLC checks no "the move ends" property).

### `reads/`: leaderless reads, for #1016 (model of leaderless reads)

The model is a copy of `zero-stall/Bypass.tla` with the acks to the clients and one leaderless
read. A reader asks a Phase-1 quorum of the configuration of its read basis for vote watermarks.
It serves the read at the maximum of the watermarks and the fence of the basis. The invariant is
`ReadSeesAcked`: a served read covers each slot that a leader acked before the read started.

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Basis` | `won`: a node learns its read basis only from a leadership that won its ballot (#260). `belief`: the basis is the configuration of the ballot that the node promised. |
| `AckBallot` | `TRUE`: a `PreReadAck` carries the ballot of the acceptor, and an answer above the basis ends the read. |
| `Hold` | `TRUE`: the decision hold of #579 (zero-stall reconfiguration). `zero-stall/` holds the full checks of the hold. |
| `Learner` | The options of #890 (learner above the leader). A reader campaigns with a stale belief, promises its own ballot and sends no `Prepare`. `strict`: the node never takes a leadership below its promise as its read basis (`main` today). `own`: option (b), the node takes the basis when the only promise above it is its own abandoned campaign. `any`: the node ignores its promise. `off`: no such campaign. |

The model has four acceptors, the configurations `{a1, a2, a3}` and `{a3, a4}`, the readers `a1`
and `a3`, one matchmaker, one slot and two ballots. The learner checks have a third ballot that
is only the abandoned campaign of a reader.

Results (`reads/checks.txt`):

| Rule | Result |
|---|---|
| The basis is the belief of the node | violation |
| A `PreReadAck` carries no ballot | violation |
| The bypass of #579 with no decision hold | violation |
| The rules of `main` | pass |
| The bypass of #579 with the decision hold | pass |
| #890, `strict` (`main` today) | pass |
| #890, option (b) | pass |
| #890, the node ignores its promise | pass |

Two more controls show that the model reaches the case of #890. `learner_stranded` finds a
leader and a reader outside its configuration whose own abandoned campaign is above it.
`learner_own_serves` finds a read that option (b) serves and that `strict` refuses.

Option (a) of #890, where the leader campaigns above the promise, adds no rule to the model: it
is one more ordinary campaign, and `reads_plain` covers it. Its cost is a leader change for each
stale campaign of a removed node. The last row passes in this model because an acceptor of the
basis configuration always reports a later ballot. It is not a recommendation: the model has
only majority quorums.

Not in the model: flexible and grid quorums, GC watermarks, matchmaker generations, the replica
tier, a read that expires, the registration of the abandoned campaign.
