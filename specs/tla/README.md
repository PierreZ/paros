# TLA+ specs

Small TLA+ models of one protocol rule. A model is checked with TLC before the rule is written
in `paros-core`. A model does not replace the simulation: it searches a small abstract protocol
completely, and the simulation tests the code that ships.

## How to run

    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh          # the checks that CI runs
    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh --all    # the long checks too

`tlc` is also in the default dev shell. CI runs the first command in the `TLA` workflow, only
when a spec, the script or the flake changes.

## Layout

Each folder is one model:

- `<Name>.tla`: the spec.
- `MC.tla`: the constants that a TLC configuration file cannot write (tuples, sets of sets).
- `<check>.cfg`: one TLC configuration.
- `checks.txt`: one line for each configuration, with the result that it must give (`pass` or
  `violation`) and where it runs (`ci` or `long`).

A check that must give `violation` is a control. It shows that the model can find the bug that
the rule prevents. A model with no control proves little.

## Models

### `zero-stall/`: Phase-1 bypassing for #579 (zero-stall reconfiguration)

The model is Matchmaker MultiPaxos (Whittaker et al., §3 and §4) with matchmakers, one
configuration for each ballot, Phase 1 over every prior configuration, and a leader that moves
from its ballot `b` to its next ballot `b2` with no Phase 1 for the free slots.

Constants select the variant:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Owner` | `OwnerPaper3`: the paper's rounds `(r, id, s)`, a proposer owns two consecutive ballots. `OwnerParos3`: paros's `(round, node)`, a ballot of another proposer is between. |
| `Check` | `TRUE`: bypass only if the matchmaker answers show no registration between `b` and `b2`. |
| `Mode` | `carry`: the leader proposes its own values again at `b2`, with no Phase 1. `p212`: frankenpaxos `Phase212`, the slots below the frontier get a Phase 1 at `b2`. `none`: no bypass. |

The invariant is `Agreement`: one value is chosen for each slot.

The model has three ballots, three matchmakers, two values, one or two slots and two
configurations of two acceptors.

Not in the model: GC watermarks, matchmaker generations, leaderless reads (the decision hold),
lost durable state and the cooperative handoff.

Results are in `zero-stall/checks.txt` and in the design document of #579 (zero-stall
reconfiguration).
