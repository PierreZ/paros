# TLA+ specs

Small TLA+ models of one protocol rule. A model is checked with TLC before the rule is written
in `paros-core`. A model does not replace the simulation: it searches a small abstract protocol
completely, and the simulation tests the code that ships.

## How to run

    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh          # the checks that CI runs
    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh --all    # the long checks too

`tlc` is also in the default dev shell. CI runs the first command in the `TLA` workflow, only
when a spec, the script or the flake changes.

## Layout

Each folder is one model:

- `<Name>.tla`: the spec.
- `MC.tla`: the constants that a TLC configuration file cannot write (tuples, sets of sets).
- `<check>.cfg`: one TLC configuration.
- `checks.txt`: one line for each configuration, with the result that it must give (`pass` or
  `violation`) and where it runs (`ci` or `long`).

A check that must give `violation` is a control. It shows that the model can find the bug that
the rule prevents. A model with no control proves little.

## Models

### `zero-stall/`: Phase-1 bypassing for #579 (zero-stall reconfiguration)

The model is Matchmaker MultiPaxos (Whittaker et al., §3 and §4) with matchmakers, one
configuration for each ballot, Phase 1 over every prior configuration, and a leader that moves
from its ballot `b` to its next ballot `b2` with no Phase 1 for the free slots.

Constants select the variant:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Owner` | `OwnerPaper3`: the paper's rounds `(r, id, s)`, a proposer owns two consecutive ballots. `OwnerParos3`: paros's `(round, node)`, a ballot of another proposer is between. |
| `Check` | `TRUE`: bypass only if the matchmaker answers show no registration between `b` and `b2`. |
| `Mode` | `carry`: the leader proposes its own values again at `b2`, with no Phase 1. `p212`: frankenpaxos `Phase212`, the slots below the frontier get a Phase 1 at `b2`. `none`: no bypass. |

The invariant is `Agreement`: one value is chosen for each slot.

The model has three ballots, three matchmakers, two values, one or two slots and two
configurations of two acceptors.

Not in the model: GC watermarks, matchmaker generations, leaderless reads (the decision hold),
lost durable state and the cooperative handoff.

Results are in `zero-stall/checks.txt` and in the design document of #579 (zero-stall
reconfiguration).

### `retire-fence/`: when a removed node may shut down, for #1002 (retire fence gaps)

The model is the control side of Matchmaker Paxos: campaigns that register a belief,
reconfigurations, the GC watermark of each matchmaker, and the retirement of a node. It has no
values and no votes. It answers one question: after a node retires, does each later campaign
still get a Phase-1 quorum of each configuration that the matchmakers give it?

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Fence` | `none`: the fence `last_member_ballot` moves only when the node hears a configuration that names it. `volatile`: a campaign also raises the fence of the node that registers, and a restart loses it (#893 (retire fence)). `durable`: the fence survives a restart. |
| `Ask` | `none`: the node retires on the five conditions of `may_retire`. `quorum`: it first asks a matchmaker quorum, and a matchmaker says yes if it holds no registration above the watermark that names the node. `quorumTomb`: the same, and a matchmaker that said yes refuses each later registration that names the node. `allTomb`: as `quorumTomb`, but every matchmaker must say yes. |
| `OperatorRule` | `TRUE`: the operator retires no node that a reconfiguration above the watermark names, and names no retired node in a reconfiguration. |
| `Phase1All` | `TRUE`: a Phase-1 quorum is every member (`q1 = n`). `FALSE`: a majority. |

The invariants are `Electable` (each matchmaker quorum gives only configurations that still have
a Phase-1 quorum) and `SomeElectable` (at least one matchmaker quorum does).

The model has three nodes, a shrink from three members to two with `q1 = n`, three matchmakers,
two ballots and one restart.

Results (`retire-fence/checks.txt`):

| Rule | `Electable` | `SomeElectable` |
|---|---|---|
| No fence, the #893 fence, a durable fence | violation | |
| Durable fence and a quorum ask (the plan of #1002 on 2026-11-11) | violation | violation |
| Durable fence, a quorum ask, and the matchmakers refuse later registrations | violation | pass |
| Durable fence, every matchmaker answers and refuses later registrations | pass | |

The quorum ask fails because a registration can arrive after the answer. A slow campaign of a
member that still believes the old configuration registers it at a matchmaker after that
matchmaker said yes. The last row also passes with `OperatorRule = FALSE`: the matchmakers then
check the operator's half of the retirement contract.

Not in the model: values and votes, the promises of the acceptors, matchmaker generations, the
pages of an answer and lost matchmaker state.
