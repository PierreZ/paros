# TLA+ specs

Small TLA+ models of one protocol rule. A model is checked with TLC before the rule is written
in `paros-core`. A model does not replace the simulation: it searches a small abstract protocol
completely, and the simulation tests the code that ships.

## How to run

    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh          # the checks that CI runs
    nix develop .#tla --command scripts/check-tla.sh --all    # the long checks too

`tlc` is also in the default dev shell. CI runs the first command in the `TLA` workflow, only
when a spec, the script or the flake changes.

## Layout

Each folder is one model:

- `<Name>.tla`: the spec.
- `MC.tla`: the constants that a TLC configuration file cannot write (tuples, sets of sets).
- `<check>.cfg`: one TLC configuration.
- `checks.txt`: one line for each configuration, with the result that it must give (`pass` or
  `violation`) and where it runs (`ci` or `long`).

A check that must give `violation` is a control. It shows that the model can find the bug that
the rule prevents. A model with no control proves little.

## Models

### `zero-stall/`: Phase-1 bypassing for #579 (zero-stall reconfiguration)

The model is Matchmaker MultiPaxos (Whittaker et al., §3 and §4) with matchmakers, one
configuration for each ballot, Phase 1 over every prior configuration, and a leader that moves
from its ballot `b` to its next ballot `b2` with no Phase 1 for the free slots.

Constants select the variant:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Owner` | `OwnerPaper3`: the paper's rounds `(r, id, s)`, a proposer owns two consecutive ballots. `OwnerParos3`: paros's `(round, node)`, a ballot of another proposer is between. |
| `Check` | `TRUE`: bypass only if the matchmaker answers show no registration between `b` and `b2`. |
| `Mode` | `carry`: the leader proposes its own values again at `b2`, with no Phase 1. `p212`: frankenpaxos `Phase212`, the slots below the frontier get a Phase 1 at `b2`. `none`: no bypass. |

The invariant is `Agreement`: one value is chosen for each slot.

The model has three ballots, three matchmakers, two values, one or two slots and two
configurations of two acceptors.

Not in the model: GC watermarks, matchmaker generations, leaderless reads (the decision hold),
lost durable state and the cooperative handoff.

Results are in `zero-stall/checks.txt` and in the design document of #579 (zero-stall
reconfiguration).

### `retire-fence/`: when a removed node may shut down, for #1002 (retire fence gaps)

The model is the control side of Matchmaker Paxos: campaigns that register a belief,
reconfigurations, the GC watermark of each matchmaker, and the retirement of a node. It has no
values and no votes. It answers one question: after a node retires, does each later campaign
still get a Phase-1 quorum of each configuration that the matchmakers give it?

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Fence` | `none`: the fence `last_member_ballot` moves only when the node hears a configuration that names it. `volatile`: a campaign also raises the fence of the node that registers, and a restart loses it (#893 (retire fence)). `durable`: the fence survives a restart. |
| `Ask` | `none`: the node retires on the five conditions of `may_retire`. `quorum`: it first asks a matchmaker quorum, and a matchmaker says yes if it holds no registration above the watermark that names the node. `quorumTomb`: the same, and a matchmaker that said yes refuses each later registration that names the node. `allTomb`: as `quorumTomb`, but every matchmaker must say yes. `quorumPrune`: as `quorumTomb`, and a candidate drops a registration from its answers when a matchmaker quorum in those answers recorded, below that registration, the retirement of a node that it names. |
| `OperatorRule` | `TRUE`: the operator retires no node that a reconfiguration above the watermark names, and names no retired node in a reconfiguration. |
| `Phase1All` | `TRUE`: a Phase-1 quorum is every member (`q1 = n`). `FALSE`: a majority. |

The invariants are `Electable` (each matchmaker quorum gives only configurations that still have
a Phase-1 quorum) and `SomeElectable` (at least one matchmaker quorum does).

The model has three nodes, a shrink from three members to two with `q1 = n`, three matchmakers,
two ballots and one restart.

Results (`retire-fence/checks.txt`):

| Rule | `Electable` | `SomeElectable` |
|---|---|---|
| No fence, the #893 fence, a durable fence | violation | |
| Durable fence and a quorum ask (the plan of #1002 on 2026-11-11) | violation | violation |
| Durable fence, a quorum ask, and the matchmakers refuse later registrations | violation | pass |
| Durable fence, every matchmaker answers and refuses later registrations | pass | |

The quorum rule with pruning (`quorumPrune`, added on 2026-11-12 to answer "what if a matchmaker is
not accessible?"):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `PruneSafe`: a candidate drops only a registration whose campaign never completed its matchmaking phase | pass |
| `ElectableAll`: with an answer of every matchmaker, no campaign is stranded | pass |
| `ElectableOneDown`: the same with one matchmaker down | violation |

So the two rules that are safe differ in what waits for a matchmaker that is down. With
`allTomb`, a retirement waits. With `quorumPrune`, an election can wait: a candidate needs the
answers of the matchmakers that recorded the retirement, and one of them can be the one that is
down. An election is on the availability path and a retirement is not, thus `allTomb` is the
rule to ship. In the `quorumPrune` checks, a campaign in the model does not win by pruning: the
invariants judge what a candidate would get in each state.

The quorum ask fails because a registration can arrive after the answer. A slow campaign of a
member that still believes the old configuration registers it at a matchmaker after that
matchmaker said yes. The last row also passes with `OperatorRule = FALSE`: the matchmakers then
check the operator's half of the retirement contract.

Not in the model: values and votes, the promises of the acceptors, matchmaker generations, the
pages of an answer and lost matchmaker state.

### `handover-gc/`: the GC floor across a handover, for #1014 (model of the handover and the GC floor)

The model is one handover of a matchmaker set, from the set `M0` to the set `M1`, with the GC
floor and the registrations of each matchmaker. It has no values, no votes and no acceptors. It
answers two questions. When a leader reports a floor as effective, does a majority of each
generation in force hold that floor? When a matchmaking phase closed at a majority, does each
majority of the generation in force still give that registration, unless a floor passed it?

A matchmaker of `M0` freezes and reports its floor and its registrations (`Stopped`). The
successor state is the maximum floor of a majority of reports and the union of their
registrations (`close_stop`). A member of `M1` activates with that state.

Constants select the rule:

| Constant | Values |
|---|---|
| `Collector` | `watermark`: the collector counts each ack whose watermark is at or above the floor, applied or refused (`Collector::fold_ack` today). `applied`: it counts only an ack that applied the request. |
| `PoolLag` | `TRUE`: the leader cannot learn the later set from a refusal, because a member of `M1` is not in its pool yet. The refusal goes to the collector. `FALSE`: the leader learns the later set and drops the ack. |
| `CloseFloor` | `max`: the successor floor is the maximum of the reports. `one`: it is the floor of one report. |
| `FrozenRegisters` | `TRUE`: a frozen matchmaker still registers a ballot. |

The invariants are `FloorCarried` (the first question) and `RegCarried` (the second).

The model has the sets `{X, Y, Z}` and `{Y, Z, W}` and two ballots.

Results (`handover-gc/checks.txt`):

| Rule | Invariant | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `watermark` collector, the leader cannot learn the later set | `FloorCarried` | violation |
| `watermark` collector, the leader learns the later set | `FloorCarried` | pass |
| `applied` collector, the leader cannot learn the later set | `FloorCarried` | pass |
| The successor floor is the floor of one report | `FloorCarried` | violation |
| A frozen matchmaker registers | `RegCarried` | violation |
| The rules of today | `RegCarried` | pass |

The first row is a floor that is effective at no majority. `X` applies the floor of ballot 1 at
generation 0. The handover closes on the reports of `Y` and `Z`, with the floor 0. Ballot 2
raises the floor of `Y` at generation 1. `Y` then refuses the request of ballot 1 for generation
0, and its refusal carries the watermark 2. The collector of ballot 1 counts `X` and `Y`: the
floor 1 is effective, but `Z` and `W` hold the floor 0. This is class 5 of item 4 of #903
(matchmaker safety and liveness).

Not in the model: the decree that chooses the successor, lost matchmaker state, the effective
configuration, the size of the successor set and more than one journal.
